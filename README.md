# CCReceitas

> CCReceitas is a fully online recipe contest platform.

Some say that cooking is a trail of good. The recipe for a preparation seems simple, passes from generation to generation and, with each hand, it becomes even better.

Now have you ever imagined yourself participating in a completely online recipe contest? Yes, in CCReceitas this is possible!
